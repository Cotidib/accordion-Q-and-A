# accordion-Q-and-A
Practice project made with React Js and React Hooks

This is my version of the Accordion project in ['Code 15 React Projects' course by John Smilga](https://youtu.be/a_7Z7C_JCyo).

### Overview and learnings
Accordion Q&A is a simple Questions and Answers display.

The main React functionality I learned is conditional rendering and styling. I made my own setup, styling and added an extra animation feature to the original idea of the project.
