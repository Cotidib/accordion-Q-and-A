# accordion-Q-and-A
Practice project made with React Js and React Hooks

### Overview and learnings
Accordion Q&A is a simple Questions and Answers display.

The main React functionality I learned is conditional rendering. I made my own setup, styling and added an extra feature to the original idea of the project.
